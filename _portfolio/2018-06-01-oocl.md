excerpts: 'OOCL employs a data science team to optimize container scheduling and routing. It was meaningful for me to have witnessed the application of Machine Learning techniques in the industry. My work involved: Predicting empty-container daily release-return quantity for ports across the world with time series models, with performances surpassing that developed by MSRA for Long Beach Port; Imputing vessel utility and empty container re-stowage with boosting, attained performance gain upon existing implementation.'
