#excerpts: 'Breaking down tissue-level gene expressions to cell-type specific gene expressions has been expensive. My research topic included improving upon and applying Tensor Componenent Analysis, a framework introduced by Sriram Lab to UK Biobank Data. Using decomposed cell-type sepecific gene expression, regression was performed onto phenotypes.'
