This is one of the queerest opening lines that I have ever read, and yet it fits perfectly as an opening line for myself in this setting. From one who was all geared towards the business world until my Sophomore year, and eventually aspiring to become a computer science researcher, my transformation, as I now reflect upon it, is the journey of self-discovery, and keep asking myself what matters.

<p> Hong Kong is a financial hub like New York. Just as Nick Carraway in the Great GatsBy was eager to gain a foothold in WallStreet, I was so eager to get a HeadStart in business after entering University. For me at that time, a tax internship position at PricewaterhousCoopers HK was exactly what I desired. But soon enough, when the cluncking of metro transportation and the fragrance of morning coffee at the office ceased to be a new sensation, I found my self mired in documents proofreading: a left-out indentation here, or a semicolon changed to comma there. The question arose in me then, why autonoumous technology had not disrupted and completely changed the landscape of accounting yet? Is manual labor more important that automation? Does what I am doing matter to me? I derived much pleasure in answering these questions myself during the internship period: I built a microsoft batch program to help automate the scanning and copying process, so no more categorizing, grouping or renaming. For the first time, the power of computer science manifests to me personally: unlike proofreading, it matters. </p>
