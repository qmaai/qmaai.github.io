excerpt: 'In this study, we deconvolute builk-level gene expressions into cell-type-specific gene expressions with cell-type weights using bayesian models, circumventing the centrifusion that traditional methods require to acqure cell-type specific gene expressions. We then associate specific gene expressions with phenotypes on UKBiobank blood tissue data.'
