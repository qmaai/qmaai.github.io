title: 'Uncertainty-Aware Model-Based Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving using PILCO'
collection: projects
permalink: /talks/2019-06-mbrl.md
excerpt: 'In this study, we bring uncertainty estimation to model based RL for autonomous driving. The model is parenthesized by a bayesian neural network to approximate PILCO and dropouts are used to estimate the uncertainty. We further train a multilayer perceptron as a controller, whose gradient could flow through the model network. We demonstrate that our model could output uncertainty towards its projections, and could navigate safely in complex environments.'
