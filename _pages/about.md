I am a final year Computer Science and Business Student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org/).

In 2019, I spent one most fantastic year in the [Strategic Reasoning Group](https://strategicreasoning.org/), University of Michigan Ann Arbor, where I was so thankful to be supervised by [Prof. Michael Wellman](http://strategicreasoning.org/michael-p-wellman/). My sincere gratitudes also go to [Prof. Tilman Borgers](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~tborgers/), whose most enlighting lectures sparked my interests in Game Theory. 

[comment]: #I also had a summer supervised by [Prof. Sankararaman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/) in UCLA and a semester in [Sensetime HK](https://www.sensetime.com/en) where [Sirui Xie](https://siruixie.com/) guided me onto the path of research.

After much exploration, I have eventually found myself deeply attracted to the intersection between Game Theory and CS. My current work is on Nash Equilibrium search in two-player games with no-regret learning and bandit frameworks.
