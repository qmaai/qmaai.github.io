excerpt: 'In Empirical Game Theoretic Analysis (EGTA), game models are iteratively extended to include the Nash Equilibrium of the underlying true games. The Strategy Exploration process dictates which new strategies to add to the game models next based on current available information. We investigate the methodological considerations in evaluating different strategy exploration processes in EGTA and highlight a consistency criteria that past literatures violate.'
