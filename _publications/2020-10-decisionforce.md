title: 'Learning a Decision Module by Imitating Driverâ€™s Control Behaviors'
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-10-decisionforce.md
excerpt: 'we propose a hybrid framework to learn neural decisions in the classical modular pipeline through end-to-end imitation learning. This hybrid framework can preserve the merits of the classical pipeline such as the strict enforcement of physical and logical constraints while learning complex driving decisions from data.'
